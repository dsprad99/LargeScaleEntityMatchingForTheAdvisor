#Large Scale Enttiy for theAdvisor

##About
theAdvisor is a project started back in 2013 to help users build a strong biblogrpahy by extneding the document set obtained after a first-level search. While there exists way of looking up papers bibliographys, many of them are innacurate due to sourcing there information utilizing computer vision.

Therefore, we have sourced our data from MAG, DBLP, and Citeseer in a diverse set of file formats such as XML, CSV, and SQL. These datasets crossrefernce each other in order to help us gain strong metadata. However, these datasets cannot be matched directly due to there being slight differences in paper titles such as weird spacing, misspellings, capitlization issues, etc. Which is why the two-phase method we used was implemented.
